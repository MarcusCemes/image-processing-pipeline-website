# Guide

## What you will learn

The guide will take you through step-by-step on how to:

- Install and run the command-line interface
- Set up a basic configuration file and pipeline
- Generate a manifest file

The CLI is the easiest way to get started with IPP, however, there are also loaders for Webpack and Vite as well as a programmatic interface for more experienced users.

## Installing Node.js

Image Processing Pipeline uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). If you are a web developer then you're probably already familiar with the runtime and bundled packaged manager npm. If not, it's very easy to install (and easy to remove once you're finished) and gives you access to a large number of web development tools.

If you already have Node.js, you may continue to the [next page](./installation).

Installing Node.js is as simple as a few clicks and it comes with npm (Node Package Manager), the easiest way to add IPP to your system or your project.

### Official installers

You can download an installer for Windows and macOS, as well as binaries for Linux, from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org) for a specific version.

If you prefer using a package manager, such as Chocolaty or Homebrew, you can try installing using that instead, although it may be a few versions behind (this shouldn't be a problem). Visit [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) for more information.

### Version manager

There are several tools for managing your Node.js installation, such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) and Volta. If you are familiar with the command line, you can try using these tools instead, as they make it a lot easier to upgrade versions in the future.
