This page will explain how to download Image Processing Pipeline using the Node Package Manager (npm for short).

Once you have downloaded and installed Node.js and npm (which comes as part of Node.js), it's as easy as typing one line into the terminal.

You can choose to install globally or per-project. If you don't need to use to use IPP from the command line, it's better to install it on a per-project basis, as it allows you to have more control over the tool's version.

## üåç Global installation

The easiest option, allows you to use IPP anywhere on your system using the command line.

```bash
$ npm install --global @ipp/cli
```

Once installed, you can use it by typing into the terminal:

```bash
$ ipp
```

Bear in mind, you will still need to configure the tool, explicitly or by creating a configuration file in the in or above the working directory.

## üì¶ Per-project installation

### Adding the dependency

If you have a project set up using npm (with a valid `package.json` file), you may add IPP to the list of your project dependencies.

:::tip
If you don't have a package.json file, you can create one by running `npm init -y`.
:::

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev @ipp/cli
```

This will add IPP to your projects development dependencies and will install it under the `node_modules` folder. If you look inside of your `package.json` file, you should see something along the lines of:

```json
{
  ...
  "devDependencies": {
    "@ipp/cli": "^4.0.0"
  }
}
```

Whenever you run `npm install`, the most recent compatible version (semver) will be installed.

### Creating an npm script

To make it easier to run IPP, it may be added to your package.json's script property. This lets you start the tool using npm.

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "build-images": "ipp"
    }
    ...
}
```

To run IPP, simply run the script using npm:

```bash
$ npm run build-images
```
