## Test-run

Fantastic! Let's try it and see what happens!

<Tabs
  groupId="install_type"
  defaultValue="global"
  values={[
    {label: '🌍 Global', value: 'global'},
    {label: '📦 Project', value: 'project'},
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="global">

```bash
$ ipp
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="project">

```bash
$ npm run <script_name>    # where <script_name> is the name of the npm script
```

<!-- </script_name></script_name> -->

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If everything is set up right, you should get a bunch of text come up on screen in red, complaining
about a configuration error. Well, you haven't told IPP what to do yet!

### Breaking it down

If no pipeline is specified, the CLI provides a sane config by default, creating 8 formats for every
image, at 4 different sizes and two codecs (original + WebP). It will also export a very simple
manifest file (more on this later). You still have to specify and input and output directory,
however.

<Tabs
  groupId="install_type"
  defaultValue="global"
  values={[
    {label: '🌍 Global', value: 'global'},
    {label: '📦 Project', value: 'project'},
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="global">

```bash
$ ipp --input images_folder --output assets_folder
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="project">

```json title="package.json" {2}
"scripts": {
    "build-images": "ipp --input images_folder --output assets_folder"
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If everything went well (and you provided some images), IPP should report completion and the output
folder should contain your newly generated formats, along with a manifest file! For many use cases,
the default configuration should be sufficient. Let's take a look on how to go a step further.

### Configuration

Image Processing Pipeline supports a few different configuration file formats and location, anything
supported by the cosmiconfig library. We recommend using the YAML format, as it makes it a lot
easier to read and write your image pipeline. Lets make a quick configuration file now:

```yaml title=".ipprc.yml"
input: images
output: build

pipeline:
  - pipe: convert
    options:
      format: webp
    save: "[source.name].webp"
```

Once you have created that file inside of your project folder, add some images to a folder called
images, create a build folder, and try running IPP again.

<Tabs
  groupId="install_type"
  defaultValue="global"
  values={[
    {label: '🌍 Global', value: 'global'},
    {label: '📦 Project', value: 'project'},
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="global">

```bash
$ ipp
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="project">

```bash
$ npm run <script_name>    # where <script_name> is the name of the npm script
```

<!-- </script_name></script_name> -->

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

That was easier! No need to specify the directory each time. If you look in your build folder, each
image should have been converted into the WebP codec, a superior, if somewhat less supported image
format. It is good practice to also create a JPEG variant for older browsers (and Safari, for some
reason...).

We'll touch more on this in the pipeline section.

### Flags

There are a few basic CLI flags that allow you to quickly confiure the CLI, namely setting the
input/output directory, a path to a configuration file and the ability to use a simple text
renderer.

See the [CLI reference](../reference/cli.mdx) to learn more.

```bash
$ ipp -i images -o build/images -c ipp-config.json --text
```
