## Test-run

Fantastic! Let's try it and see what happens!

<Tabs
  groupId="install_type"
  defaultValue="global"
  values={[
    {label: '🌍 Global', value: 'global'},
    {label: '📦 Project', value: 'project'},
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="global">


```bash
$ ipp
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="project">


```bash
$ npm run <script_name>    # where <script_name> is the name of the npm script
```

<!-- </script_name></script_name> -->

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


If everything is set up right, you should get a bunch of text come up on screen, including the
program's banner, and some red text complaining about a configuration error. Well, you haven't told
IPP what to do!

### Breaking it down

The CLI package provides an optional sane-default config, creating 8 formats for every image, at 4
different sizes and two codecs (original + WebP). It will also export a very simple manifest file
(more on this later).

<Tabs
  groupId="install_type"
  defaultValue="global"
  values={[
    {label: '🌍 Global', value: 'global'},
    {label: '📦 Project', value: 'project'},
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="global">


```bash
$ ipp --input images_folder --output assets_folder --default
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="project">


```json title="package.json" {2}
"scripts": {
    "build-images": "ipp --input images_folder --output assets_folder --default"
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


If you provided some images, the output folder should now have some generated formats, along with a
manifest file. For very simple use-cases, the default configuration may even be sufficient, although
it purposely does not use any external pipes that provide more interesting possibilities.

### Configuration

Image Processing Pipeline supports a few different configuration file formats and location, anything
supported by the cosmiconfig library. We recommend using the YAML format, as it makes it a lot
easier to read and write your image pipeline. Lets make a quick configuration file now:

```yaml title=".ipprc.yml"
input: images
output: build

pipeline:
  - pipe: convert
    options:
      format: webp
    save: "{{originalName}}.webp"
```

Once you have created that file inside of your project folder, add some images to a folder called
images create a build folder, and try running IPP again.

<Tabs
  groupId="install_type"
  defaultValue="global"
  values={[
    {label: '🌍 Global', value: 'global'},
    {label: '📦 Project', value: 'project'},
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="global">


```bash
$ ipp
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="project">


```bash
$ npm run <script_name>    # where <script_name> is the name of the npm script
```

<!-- </script_name></script_name> -->

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


That's better! If you look inside your build folder, you will find that every source image was
converted to the WebP image format, a superior, if somewhat less supported image format. This is why
you should also created a JPEG variant, and give the browser the option to use both according to
it's preference. To see a complete example of a useful configuration file, visiting the
configuration documentation.

### Flags

There are a few basic CLI flags that allow you to override the input directory, output directory and
configuration file to load. Most of the time, it's best to set these values in the config file and
put it in one of the well-known locations.

```bash
$ ipp -i images -o build/images -c ipp-config.json
```
