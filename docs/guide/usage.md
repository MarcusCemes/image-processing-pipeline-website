# Usage

This page will explain how to use the IPP command-line interface that you just installed.

## Taking it out for a spin

Fantastic, let's try to run it and see what happens!

```shell
# Globally installed
$ ipp

# Locally installed
$ npm exec ipp
# or
$ npm run build_images_script
```

Oh dear, there's a lot of red text, that can't be good:

```text
  ‚óè Invalid configuration

    An input directory containing images must be specified
    An output directory for generated formats must be specified

    Did you create a configuration file?

Well, you haven't told IPP what to do yet!
