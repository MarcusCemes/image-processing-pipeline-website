## Understanding the image pipeline

The processing pipeline as at the heart of IPP. It provides a flexible way to configure the image
treatment process to your particular needs, whether you only wish to compress images or make a full
set of breakpoint-resized images.

To understand the pipeline, think of it as a tree-like structure of interconnetced pipes. Each
pipeline as an entry point, through which the source image passes through. As it goes through each
pipe, the image can be transformed in some way, such as being resized or converted into a different
codec. The next pipe will then recieve a copy of the new image.

Each pipe can only have one input, but multiple outputs.

At different points you can tap into the pipeline to "leak out" a copy of the image buffer and save
it to a file. This lets you save the result of a pipe and is generally what you would want to do at
the very end of the pipeline (otherwise the processing happens for nothing!).

### Image metadata

The actual object that passes through the pipeline is a DataObject. It is an binary image buffer
accompanied with a _metadata_ object (a key-value map) that contains information about the image,
such as the dimensions and format.

This makes it easy for each pipe to inspect the metadata, and modify it as needed along with the
image buffer. For example, if the pipe was to convert the image to a different format, it should
also update the `format` fieldsin the metadata to reflect this change.

Don't worry, this is handled by developer and not the end user. The metadat object _is_ still useful
for you, however. For example, when saving an image (or generating the manifest), you may use
metadata values to dynamically generate the file name (or extract useful information about the
format).

We'll touch more on this later.

## An example pipeline

The pipeline is defined in the configuration file under the pipeline property. Here's an example of
how you might define one:

<Tabs
  groupId="config_format"
  defaultValue="yaml"
  values={[
    {label: 'YAML', value: 'yaml'},
    {label: 'JSON', value: 'json'},
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="yaml">

```yaml title=".ipprc.yml"
pipeline:
  - pipe: resize
    options:
      resizeOptions:
        height: 1280
    save: "[source.name]-[width][ext]"
    then:
      - pipe: convert
        options:
          format: webp
        save: "[source.name]-[width][ext]"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="json">

```json title=".ipprc.json"
{
  "pipeline": [
    {
      "pipe": "resize",
      "options": {
        "resizeOptions": {
          "height": 1280
        }
      },
      "save": "[source.name][width][ext]",
      "then": [
        {
          "pipe": "convert",
          "options": {
            "format": "webp"
          },
          "save": "[source.name][width][ext]"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
:::tip
Both YAML and JSON formats are supported, we recommend using YAML, as it has a more concise and
easier to read syntax.
:::
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

If we provide a sufficiently large image file called parrot.jpg to the above pipeline, this process
should yield two outputs, parrot-1280.jpg and parrot-1280.webp. Notice that we used _template
literals_ (using square brackets) to dynamically generate the filename using the metadata.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
:::info
It can be hard to see what metadata is available, there is no solution for this yet. Check the
reference for each pipe to see what metadata it provides. By default, basic properties such as
`width`, `height`, `format`, `hash`, `ext` and `name` are always available.
:::
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Every **pipeline chunk** is an _array of pipes_. The pipeline property of the configuration file
defines the entry point, the first pipes to receive the source image. Consecutive pipes can then be
chained after each pipe using the `then` property to cascade transformations.

Here, each source image will flow into the resize pipe, where they get reduced to 1280 pixels in
width, before being saved to a file called `[originalName][ext]`. As well as the saved file, the
image object also then is passed to a convert pipe that creates a WebP variant, and saves that using
the same name. The use of template literals ensures that a unique name is generated for each
variant, as WebP uses a different file extension (.webp).

### Metadata expansions

To be able to dynamically create file names, IPP supports a **template literals** (you may also know
this concept as template expansions). The square bracket notation tells IPP to replace that item
with its corresponding metadata value when the file is being saved. The text inside of the brackets
is used as the **key** for the metadata object.

Accessing metadata is done in three parts, using a **selector**, a **key** and a **limit**.

The selector is used to select the context, like a folder. For example, when the image is first
loaded, most basic metadata (such as the name, size) is saved under the `source` selector, **so that
it is not overwritten during the pipeline** (as the size may change, for example).

The key is used to select the actual metadata item. `name` usually refers to the filename including
the extension.

The limit it used to limit the length of the replaced value, this is useful for limiting hashes
which can be over 256 charcaters long!

Let's see a complete example.

```yaml
pipeline:
  ...
  save: "[source.name]-[source.hash:8][ext]""
```

This could produce a filename such as "parrot-4e9004e6.jpeg", where the original file was called
"parrot.jpeg" and the MD5 hash of the original file was "4e9004e6fe9d3ffd7933e5e4f9dd534f".

If you wish to learn more about the metadata object, see the
[architecture](../concept/architecture.mdx) page.

### Connecting more pipes

As touched on in the example, pipes may be chained using the `then` property. IPP will correctly
orchestrate the process to make sure that each pipe is able to carry out its task correctly.
