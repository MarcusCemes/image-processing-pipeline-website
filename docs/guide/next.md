Congratulations! You have finished the guide!

If you are still a little confused by all the IPP terminology, we recommend taking a look at the
[architecture](../concept/architecture.mdx) to get a better idea of what moving parts there are and
how they work together.

If you are working with a website bundling tool such as [webpack][webpack], there is an official
[loader](../webpack/overview.mdx) that allows you to import images without manually processing them yourself.

If you would like to implement the build process yourself, and would only like a function that
takes in source images and returns formats, check out the
[advanced usage](../advanced/overview.mdx) section.
