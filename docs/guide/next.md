# What's next?

**ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! You have finished this guide!**

How you're still a little confused by all the terminology, see [how it works](../how-it-works.md) to get a better idea of how all the moving pieces work together.

If you are working with a website bundler such as Webpack, there is an [official loader](../integrations/webpack.md) that allows you to process images automatically by importing them from your code.

If you would like to use IPP directly from within your code, such as in a backend service, see the [programmatic interface](../integrations/programmatic.md) which allows you to call IPP as an asynchronous function, returning the processed images.

If you have questions, feel free to visit the [GitHub Discussions][github-discussions] where you can talk directly to the developers and other users of the library.
