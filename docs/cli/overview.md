The command line interface is the easiest way to get started with IPP. It provides a wrapper around
the core library with extra features.

The CLI is able to load an IPP configuration file from several well-known locations, recursively
search folders for recognised image files and process them in parallel, optionally generating an
accompanying manifest file.

This section assumes you are familiar with Node.js and npm and will take you through the setup
process.
