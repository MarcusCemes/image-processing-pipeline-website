## Importing the image

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

import { FormatTable } from "@site/src/components/utility/Table";

The Webpack loader is designed for importing images into a Javascript file. This is a pattern that
works well with libraries such as React, Vue, Angular, etc, as it allows you to then process that
image import, for exemple to generate a `<picture>` element.

<Tabs
groupId="js-syntax"
defaultValue="es"
values={[
  { label: "ES Module", value: "es" },
  { label: "CommonJS", value: "cjs" },
]}
>
<TabItem value="es">

```js
import image from "path/to/image.jpg";
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cjs">

```js
const image = require("path/to/image.jpg");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

When you import an image, the loader will transform that image behind the scenes by processing it
with IPP using the configured pipeline, saving each generated format along with other bundled
website assets.

The import is replaced with a JavaScript object that contains information about the export, such as
the URL of each format.

## Import mode

There are two import modes available. Both modes generate the same image formats.

### Simple mode

Simple mode will attempt to do some sane processing of the pipeline result to make it as easy as
possible to plug it into a `<picture>` element.

It will group images together by format, generating a `srcset` string for each one along with each
image's dimensions, and attempt to select the best "fallback" image for the `src` property.
Additionally, the original height and width are provided to make it easier to calculate layout if
you plan on loading images lazily.

```js title="Example simple export"
import image from "path/to/image.jpg";

// image is an object
{
  src: "f8c1421b4334c1c9.jpg",
  width: 1920,
  height: 1080,
  srcset: {
    "image/jpeg": "46de0d3babc16786.jpg 720w, 885001be48ef4667.jpg 1920w",
    "image/webp": "f876c5d47c6c0866.webp 720w, 5eb716978a1b5a09.webp 1920w"
  }
}
```

### Manifest mode

Manifest mode gives you more control over the information that you would like to extract from the
pipeline result. It is enabled by specifying `manifest` key in the loader's options.

It is practically identical to the implementation used by the CLI, with support for selectors,
limiting, except that you only receive the manifest item for that particular import, and not a list
of every single sucessful result. Take a look at the [manifest documentation](../cli/manifest.mdx)
for the CLI to learn more.

```js title="Example manifest export"
import image from "path/to/image.jpg";

// image is an object
{
  s: {
    w: 1920,
    h: 1080,
  },
  f: [
    {
      w: 720,
      f: "jpeg",
      p: "46de0d3babc16786.jpg"
    },
    {
      w: 720,
      f: "webp",
      p: "f876c5d47c6c0866.webp"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Development builds

To make the development experience more pleasant, images will not be processed in non-production
environments. This is determined by the `NODE_ENV` environmental variable which should be set
automatically by Webpack. Instead, images will be passed through untouched with a `saveKey` of
`true`.

It is possible to override this behaviour by specifying a `devBuild: true` key in the loader's
options. This may be useful to preview how images will look in the final build.
