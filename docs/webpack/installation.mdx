## Installing the package

The webpack loader must be added as an npm project dependency:

```bash
$ npm install @ipp/webpack
```

Any additional pipes that you wish to use that are not part of `@ipp/core` must also be installed
seperatly. This lets you explicitly choose features that you would like to enable and reduce the
installation size.

```bash
$ npm install @ipp/compress @ipp/primitive
```

:::danger Installation problems
If the installation fails, you may need to either downgrade Node.js or install some additional
compilers. See the [installation problems](../getting-started/troubleshooting.mdx#Installation-problems) section in
the troubleshooting guide.

## Configuring webpack

Next, you must configure webpack to use the `@ipp/webpack` loader. Depending on your toolchain
(create-react-app, next.js, vue-cli, parcel, custom, ...), the method to manually configure the
webpack configuration will vary. Refer to the documentation of your chosen tool.

Once you have a way to modify your webpack configuration, you may configure configure new rules to
process certain images. Webpack is as flexible as you like, you could for example use different
pipelines depending on which folder the image resides in. For this example, we will just attempt to
load all images with IPP.

```js title="webpack.config.js" {4-12}
module.exports = {
  ...
  rules: [
    {
      loader: require.resolve("@ipp/webpack"),
      test: /.(png|jpg|jpeg|webp)$/,
      options: {
        pipeline: [
          {
            pipe: "resize",
            options: {
              resizeOptions: {
                width: 1280
              }
            },
            save: "[name]-[hash:8][ext]"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
...
}
```

The above regular expression test will match _any_ file with a png, jpg, jpeg or webp extension and
use IPP process the image import. In this example, the image is resized to 1280 pixels wide and
given a unique file name.

:::caution
If you already have a generated webpack configuration, such as the one that comes with the
create-react-app, it may _already_ have loaders that handle images. You must find a way to
**disable** those loaders, otherwise all loaders that test for the file will be **chained**
together in series.

In order for IPP to work correctly, it requires raw access to the original image and no other loader
will understand its JSON export format. To see an example, see the [workaround][workaround] that was
used for this website.
