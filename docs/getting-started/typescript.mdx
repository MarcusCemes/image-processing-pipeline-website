Image Processing Pipeline is written in [TypeScript][typescript], therefore providing strong
integration out of the box. The use of TypeScript in your project is completely **optional**.

TypeScript declaration files are generated at build time and published together with source files to
the package registry, giving you immediate IDE feedback and autocomplete functionality without any
additional configuration.

IPP's shared types, such as the pipeline interfaces, have been grouped and exported from the
`@ipp/common` package. You may add this package to your dependencies to explicitly import these
types into your code.

- Provide an example
- Discourage new users of adopting due to initial friction/development
- VSCode provides assistance even in plain JS
