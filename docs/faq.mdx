## Performance

Image Processing Pipeline runs on Node.js, which uses the [V8](https://v8.dev/) runtime for JavaScript. The primary underlying image library uses bindings to [libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips), which is extremely fast and memory efficient, written mostly in C. Creating four sets of resized WebP+JPEG image pairs, passing them through good compression algorithms such as mozjpeg, takes between 300-400ms on good hardware.

The JavaScript layer overhead is minimal, apart from a slight start-up delay due to the horrendous way that npm handles packages. This language was chosen due to it's cross-platform interpreted simplicity, and the fact that most of front-end web development is already handled by the Node.js/npm combo.

Depending on your pipeline and image options, it can take more or less time to complete the pipeline, but considering that it uses the best down-scaling algorithms available by default, the only way you'll get anything faster is by sacrificing quality. The longest operations are usually compression algorithms.
