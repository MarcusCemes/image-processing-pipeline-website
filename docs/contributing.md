Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire,
and create. Image Processing Pipeline is an open-source project released under the permissive MIT
license.

Any contributions you make will benefit everybody else and are greatly appreciated.

## How to contribute

1. **Fork** the Project on GitHub
2. Create your **feature branch** (`git checkout -b feat/AmazingFeature`)
3. Update/modify **unit tests** if necessary
4. **Commit** your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
5. **Push** to the origin (`git push origin feat/AmazingFeature`)
6. Open a **pull request** with the main repository

### Unit tests

The Image Processing Pipeline uses Jest for unit testing. This ensures that the code functions correctly and prevent regression. Unit tests should *describe* the desired code's behaviour with clear and understandable language. Contributions that modify the behaviour of the code in any way should update the associated unit tests.

If you have added/modified/removed a feature, you may need to add or remove tests accordingly.

If you have fixed a bug, it may be beneficial to add a test that demonstrates the fixed behaviour.
