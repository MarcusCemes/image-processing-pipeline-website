Both the command line interface and the webpack loader are wrappers around the core library,
handling implementation details such as the output location, live information and output manifest
generation.

If you need a little more control over the IPP implementation, you can write your own
wrapper/adapter that uses the code library, while still abstracting away the image processing
details.
