## CLI Flags

These allow you to quickly override the input/output folders as well as force a particular
configuration file, overriding the default config search behavoir.

More advanced configuration must be done via a configuration file.

| `-i`, `--input`  | Path to the input directory _(required)_           |
| `-o`, `--output` | Path to the output directory _(required)_          |
| `-c`, `--config` | Manually specify the configuration file            |
| `--text`         | Use the Text UI instead of the default Terminal UI |

## Programatic Invocation

The `@ipp/cli` package also exports two functions, `init` and `startCli`. They are the same
functions that are run when the CLI is invoked from the command line.

The `init` function will attempt to parse command line flags and load a config before calling the
second function, `startCli`, which takes a config and additional options directly as parameters and
runs the main program logic.
