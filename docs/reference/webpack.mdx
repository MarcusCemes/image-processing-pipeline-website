## Development builds

By default, images are only processed using the provided pipeline if the environmental variable
`NODE_ENV` is set to `production` in your terminal. This is usually automatically set by webpack
when creating the build. Otherwise, the source image is passed through to avoid unnecessary work.

If you would like to also preview the generated formats when not running in production, such as when
running a development server, you may set the `devBuild` loader option to `true`.

## Simple / Manifest mode

The import mode is determined by the presence of the `manifest` option. If it is present, the loader
will use _manifest mode_, otherwise it defaults to _simple mode_.

### Simple mode

This mode provides only basic information about the source image dimensions, and attempts to
construct `srcset` strings for each MIME based on the format file extension. It also provides a
`src` fallback image for older devices, which is determined as the "most relevant fallback image",
prefereably a JPEG closed to having dimensions of `1920Ã—1080`.

```js title="image_import.ts"
import image from "path/to/image.jpg";

// image is an object
{
  src: "f8c1421b4334c1c9.jpg",
  width: 1920,
  height: 1080,
  srcset: {
    "image/jpeg": "46de0d3babc16786.jpg 720w, 885001be48ef4667.jpg 1920w",
    "image/webp": "f876c5d47c6c0866.webp 720w, 5eb716978a1b5a09.webp 1920w"
  }
}
```

## Manifest mode

This mode gives you full control over exported metadata information for each format and the source
image, very similar to the the manifest generation of the CLI.

The loader adds some extra metadata information to each format. The `path` key corresponds to the
exported image's path, and the `save` key correponds to the save key used to mark the format for
export.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
:::tip
Any template literals present in the save key are also processed and replaced by their corresponding
metadata values, similar to the way filenames are generated from the save key in the CLI.

A save key of `[width]` will be replaced with the resulting format's horizontal dimension.

### Example

An example speaks a thousant words.

```js title="webpack.config.js"
...
options: {
  manifest: {
    source: {
      x: "hash:8"
    },
    format: {
      w: width,
      p: path,
      s: save,
    }
  },
  pipeline: [{
    pipe: resize,
    save: "resized-[width][ext]"
  }]
}
...
```

```ts title="image_import.ts"
import image from "path/to/image.jpg";

// image is an object
{
  s: {
    x: "7fd315fd"
  },
  f: [{
    w: 1920,
    p: "img/9035d003",
    s: "resized-1920.jpg"
  }]
}
```
