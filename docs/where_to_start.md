We've tried to make this documentation as accessible as possible for everyone, regadless of
background knowledge. Image Processing Pipeline is flexible and be simply used as a script to batch
resize a set of images or integrated into a more complex backend that needs to conduct some image
processing.

If you are not familiar with programming, or just wish to try it out, we recommend starting with the
[guide](guide/prerequisites.mdx).

If you would like to integrate IPP more programmatically into your project, we recommend checking
out the official [webpack loader](webpack/overview.mdx).

If you would like to integrate the raw processing capabilities of IPP into your own codebase, check
out the [advanced usage](advanced/overview.mdx) section that goes into more detail on how to
implement IPP's core functionality.
