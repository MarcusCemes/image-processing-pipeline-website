Image Processing Pipeline uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). If you're a web developer then you're probably using it already! If not, the installation is simple and it will give you access to a large number of other web development tools.

If you already have Node.js, you may continue to the next page.

## First steps

### Installing Node.js

Installing Node.js is a simple as a few clicks and it comes with npm (Node Package Manager), the largest package registry in the world and also the best way to install IPP.

<Tabs
  groupId="os"
  defaultValue="win"
  values={[
    {label: 'Windows', value: 'win'},
    {label: 'macOS', value: 'mac'},
    {label: 'Linux', value: 'linux'},
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="win">


#### Easy

There is an installer available at https://nodejs.org/. This will install a recent version of Node.js and the accompanying Node Package Manager (npm).

#### Hard

Download and install nvm, a port of the popular nvm (Node Version Manager) on Linux that easily lets you install, upgrade and remove different versions of Node.js. You may then do:

```
$ nvm install latest
$ nvm use latest
```
